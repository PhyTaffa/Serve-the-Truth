# **How to Run This Server on Your 'State-of-the-Art' Machine (RIP)**

Hey, hey people. Filippo here.

Congratulations! You've just set foot in the **wonderful, soul-crushing world of server hosting**, where your **glorious, state-of-the-art machine** (aka the potato you call your "gaming rig") will become a **fully-fledged server**. Itâ€™s going to be **an adventure**â€¦ mostly involving screaming at your screen.

---

### **1. Open the Project in VS Code (You Actually Managed to Do This)**

So, you cloned the repo from GitHub. Incredible. Now, open it in **VS Code**, the sacred text editor of our times. I mean, if youâ€™re still using Notepad, Iâ€™m amazed you even found this readme without getting lost on the way. Open that folder, press that shiny **VS Code** button, and letâ€™s see if you can navigate your way out of this nightmare. No pressure. But, you know, thereâ€™s *always* pressure.

---

### **2. Install the Magic Packages (Not as Hard as It Sounds, I Swear)**

Okay, now itâ€™s time to **actually work**, but donâ€™t panic, itâ€™s not that bad. You wonâ€™t have to sell your soul or figure out why your computer is making weird noises. Just open a **PowerShell terminal** (because thatâ€™s what all the cool kids use, right?) inside VS Code and run this command:

```bash
npm install express express-session mysql2 cors nodemon
```

**CCP-Approvedâ„¢**

I know what youâ€™re thinking: *Why in the hell do I need all this stuff?* Letâ€™s break it down, champ:

- **express**: Because setting up an HTTP server by hand is for **absolute masochists** who clearly have nothing better to do.
- **express-session**: It will remember you. Unlike that one game where you forgot to save and lost hours of progress. Donâ€™t worry, your server will always remember you.
- **mysql2**: Because your server needs to talk to a **database**â€”and **database** sounds like something you canâ€™t escape from, but itâ€™s just a fancy word for "data storage" that will never, ever, ever work on the first try.
- **cors**: It makes your server not spontaneously combust when it talks to the outside world. Your server wonâ€™t implode from external requests, but donâ€™t hold your breath for anything else.
- **nodemon**: This tool restarts your server when you make changes. In other words, it's a tool that does **half the work for you**, and weâ€™re all about that lazy life.

Once you type this out, hit **Enter**, and sit back. The terminal will work its magic and install everything while you stare blankly at the screen and wonder if youâ€™ve made a terrible mistake.

---

### **3. Update Database Information (Do NOT Mess This Up)**

Here it is: the **danger zone**. This is where everything can go horribly, horribly wrong. Forget the database credentials, and you'll end up with a server that's **more useless than your childhood dreams**. Open the `database.js` file and change the database information to something *you can actually use*.

Youâ€™ll need to update:

- **host**: Set this to 'localhost' if youâ€™re keeping it simple, or *go big* with a remote server. But remember, thatâ€™s a step into **uncharted waters**, so donâ€™t get cocky.
- **user**: Your **MySQL username**. Pro tip: It's **not** 'root'. I know, itâ€™s a shocker.
- **password**: Remember that password you set? Yeah, itâ€™s the one you donâ€™t share with anyone. Hopefully you still remember it.
- **database**: The name of the database. It **better exist**, because this isnâ€™t a guessing game. *Throwing random words at it wonâ€™t help*.

Hereâ€™s what your `database.js` should look like once you update it:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql2');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',  // Change this if you're a masochist and using a remote server
  user: 'your_db_user',  // Not 'root', for the love of God
  password: 'your_db_password',  // You remembered this, right?
  database: 'your_db_name'  // Yes, this must exist. Please donâ€™t just type gibberish
});
```

If you **donâ€™t** mess this up, your server will **thank you**. If you do, well, prepare for **total anarchy**.

---

### **4. Run the Server (Prepare for Glory)**

Alright, enough procrastinating. Itâ€™s time to launch this **beast**. Open up a **Command Prompt** (because weâ€™re not about that "fancy" PowerShell life for this step), and run:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

This magical incantation will summon your server into existence. **Donâ€™t panic** when your screen fills up with text like youâ€™re trying to read the matrix. Thatâ€™s just the server doing its thing. Youâ€™ll see something like this:

```
Server is running on http://0.0.0.0:3000 ðŸ¤™
Connected to the database! Please donâ€™t break anything.
```

You did it. **Congratulations**, your server is now alive, and it will **exist until it inevitably breaks**, which will happen because servers have a way of doing that. 

---

### **5. Stop the Madness (Before It Consumes Your Soul)**

Want to stop the server? Maybe youâ€™re tired, maybe the **CCP is watching**, or maybe you just want to play more **breeders of nephelim**. Whatever the case, donâ€™t sweat it. You donâ€™t need to restart your whole computer like a savage.

Just press **Ctrl + C** in your **Command Prompt**, and your server will peacefully die. Itâ€™s that easy. The **circle of life** continues, and you can resume living in your perpetual state of confusion.

---

**Thatâ€™s It!** Youâ€™ve officially set up a server that will run until your "state-of-the-art" machine decides itâ€™s had enough. If you run into any issues, just blame your database, your toaster, or your hamster whoâ€™s secretly running the server behind your back.

Good luck, and may your server bring you more joy than that one time you tried to set up a Minecraft server. Or, at the very least, more joy than the last 45 minutes of your life you just spent reading this.

---

### Additional Notes:

- **Remember**: Your server will break. It always does. Itâ€™s not a matter of *if*, but *when*. Be prepared to troubleshoot, possibly for hours.
- If this guide somehow helped you get the server running, Iâ€™d love a thank-you note. Or, you know, a **massive cash donation**. Just saying.
- Also, donâ€™t forget: **The CCP is always watching**.
